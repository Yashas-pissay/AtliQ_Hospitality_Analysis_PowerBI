# Project Overview

The Power BI report delves into three months of booking data, providing actionable insights and recommendations for pricing and cost-cutting strategies. This initiative is geared towards aiding AtliQ Grands in boosting revenue and reclaiming market share.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands, with a legacy of 20 years in the hospitality industry, is experiencing a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotels category due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making. To counter this, the managing director aims to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" for market share and revenue recovery. However, the absence of an in-house data analytics team poses a challenge in obtaining the necessary insights.

## Project Objectives 

- Create metrics based on the provided metric list.
- Develop a dashboard aligned with stakeholder mock-ups.
- Generate relevant insights beyond the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Approach

- Utilize the provided mock-up dashboard.
- Perform data collection, exploration, and transformation.
- Implement data modeling and preparations.
- Seek feedback from stakeholders for continuous improvements.

## Key Metrics

This initiative highlighted crucial metrics essential for success in the hospitality domain:

- **ADR (Average Daily Revenue):** The average payment for rooms sold in a given time period.
- **DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights):** The average number of rooms booked per day during a time period.
- **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** The average number of rooms available for sale per day.
- **DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights):** The average number of rooms successfully used by customers per day.
- **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)**
- **Occupancy Percentage:** Percentage of successfully booked rooms out of total capacity.
- **No-Show Rate:** Percentage of customers who fail to show up for bookings.
- **Realization Percentage:** Percentage of successfully checked-out bookings and overall bookings made.

*Note: In the hospitality domain, weekends are considered as Friday and Saturday nights.*

## Findings/Insights

Upon analyzing the data, several insights emerged:
- Developed 4 Dashboards for Overall Analysis, Booking Analysis, Revenue Analysis, and Key Metrics.
- The analysis is done on various parameters to give a proper insight from the requirement mentioned by the revenue team.
- We need to focus more on Elite customers across the cities as they drive the revenue boost. RT2 Room type should be prioritized more as it has the highest influence on revenue.
- We should make a good connection with the make your trip and log trip platforms. The last two weekends should be in focus to create a balance in realized revenue.
- Over three months (May, June, and July), AtliQ Grands achieved a revenue of approximately 1.7 billion (1.69b), with positive trends in Revenue, ADR, occupancy, and RevPAR.
- The overall average rating improved to 3.62, indicating enhanced customer satisfaction.
- Weekends consistently showed higher occupancy rates, suggesting a flat pricing strategy.
- Other travel platforms contributed 40% of total bookings and revenue, while direct offline booking had a minimal impact at 5%.
- The luxury room category dominated both revenue and bookings, with Mumbai leading in revenue.

## Recommendations

Given the industry dynamics, AtliQ Grands is advised to:

- Employ dynamic pricing for increased revenue on peak days and weekends.
- Implement targeted marketing campaigns for offline booking platforms.
- Analyze guest demand in different periods for optimized revenue.
- Prioritize customer reviews to enhance satisfaction.
- Explore opportunities for increased direct bookings via the hotel's website.

## Conclusion

The Power BI analysis has provided valuable insights into AtliQ Grands Hotel's management, offering optimization avenues and growth strategies. Consistent monitoring of key metrics is crucial for sustained success.
